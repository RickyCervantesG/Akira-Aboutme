    <h3> Backstory </h3>
    <p> Tetsuo was given up to an orphanage as a small child where he met his longtime friend that he relied upon, Kaneda. Tetsuo would look as Kaneda as a role model and joined his gang of misfits in later years were they will rival with a motocycle gang that wears clown makeup and helmets. During one of their raids Tetsuo gets badly injured after crashing into an esper and gains powers, he is taken away by helicopter and surveyed by scientist. This is where he becomes insane and his temper increase as he grows an addiction to capsules. 
        He later would resent Kaneda because he feels that he is of no use and has always relied on him. The finale was a fight to the death between longtime friends, Kaneda and Tetsuo. Unfortunately Tetsuo loses as his power begins to overtake him and he explodes in a massive black ball of energy.
